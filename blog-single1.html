						<h2> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/plastic-wars/"> Bessie Mears: The Ultimate Victim of <i>Native Son</i> </a></h2>
						<p>The 1986 film adaptation of Richard Wright’s <i>Native Son</i> eliminates the rape, murder, and objectification of Bessie Mears while maintaining the novel’s theme of the inferiority of black women in the eyes of society through the act of erasing her. </p>
						<p>The film of <i>Native Son</i> chooses not to show Bessie Mears’s story, prioritizing the need for a sympathetic protagonist, while the novel characterizes Bessie and black womanhood as the subject of use and objectification. For example, in the novel, after Bigger rapes and kills Bessie, her body is brought into the courtroom and used as evidence for Mary’s trial. (330). Bessie is objectified and given no dignity when her body is displayed in this horrifying manner, and the act that she doesn’t get her own case shows her irrelevance to the society around her, including Bigger. Bigger first mentions his “girl” when trying to calm down, placing her at the end of a long list of “[Stimuli] powerful enough to focus his attention and drain off his energies” (28). Bessie’s meaning to Bigger as that of relief, especially in a sexual manner, and the fact that she is placed at the end of his list of stress relief aids shows her unimportance to him, even as his tool. Later, when Bigger masturbates in the movie theatre, he wishes he “had Bessie here now” (30).  Bigger’s degrading mentality towards Bessie as a sexual object explains how he thinks of her only in relation to the fulfillment of his needs. His wish to see her while masturbating is a wish to use her for his own pleasure. Bigger’s treatment of Bessie as a commodity is not specific to their relationship but is a societal norm for the treatment of black women in general. For example, when Bigger tells his family that he got a job with the Daltons, his brother Buddy says, “You got a good job now. You can get a better girl than Bessie” (104). The idea that Bessie is something that can be replaced makes her comparable to an old phone, something that Bigger should get rid of and replace. Indeed, when Bessie becomes too much trouble for Bigger, he does just this by brutally murdering her.</p>
						<p>In both the novel and the film, Bessie is an unimportant side story in Bigger’s life. She is almost nonexistent in the movie. In both the film and novel, when Bessie appears at Ernie’s and sees Bigger with Mary and Jan, he disregards her (73). Since Bessie’s value to Bigger is based upon her utility, he doesn’t want to be with her when he is not receiving benefit from her, purposefully avoiding her contact in the presence of the white couple. Similarly, in the novel, Bigger kills Bessie because she is no longer useful to him, smashing her head in with a brick directly after raping her. After her rape she becomes worthless to Bigger, and he disposes of her without second thought. He doesn’t want to deal with her “crying all the time” and “wanting whiskey to help her forget” and kills her because of it (235). Bessie’s unimportance to Bigger is also apparent when her murder is juxtaposed with Mary’s. Bigger forgets about Bessie until her body appears in court, and feels little guilt for her, only “a deeper sympathy for [her] than at any time when she was alive” (331). He feels bad that she is being used even though has used her repeatedly and killed her for his personal gain. Additionally, the fact that Bigger feels sympathy for Bessie, not guilt or remorse for his own actions against her shows how detached he is from her; in fact, Bigger feels more guilt regarding Mary’s death than he ever does about Bessie’s. He says, “Her death was unimportant besides that of Mary’s; he knew that when they killed him it would be for Mary’s death, not Bessie’s” (304).  Bigger should feel worse about his deliberate and destructive murder of Bessie, but feels more culpability over Mary’s accidental murder, exemplifying his opinion of the black woman as insignificant in comparison to the white one. This is paralleled by the city’s treatment of the women, as the entire Black-belt is shut down to search for Mary’s killer while Bessie doesn’t even get her own trial. At the end of the novel, Bigger still struggles to come to terms with the murder of Mary but makes no attempt to do the same with Bessie, justifying this murder as an attempt to protect himself from capture. </p>
<p>Though some may say that Bessie is no longer portrayed as a victim in the film, the fact that she is almost completely erased is a form of oppression which enforces the view of the black woman as unimportant. Hollywood has a history of marginalizing racial minorities, and this is exactly what happens to Bessie in order to simplify the complex problems of the novel and make Bigger more sympathetic and justified in his actions. While Mary’s murder can be portrayed as an accident caused by Bigger’s fear of being caught alone in a bedroom with a white woman, Bessie’s murder is undoubtedly murder, deliberate in thought and action, and simply for Bigger’s convenience. The film doesn’t show this because it makes Bigger harder to relate to, more of a true murderer rather than a young man who made a bad mistake. While this makes Bigger less complicated and more likeable, and the story less intense and disturbing, it also reduces the thought-provoking nature of the work, which makes us look more deeply into the protagonist’s complicated character. However, taking Bessie out of the film to achieve these goals is simply another way of using her, just as Bigger does throughout the book. In the novel, Bessie is utterly disregarded by Bigger and the society around her, a theme which is continued in the film through her expulsion from the story. In the novel, Bessie is murdered by Bigger, and though this doesn’t occur in the film, her murder still occurs, only this time the filmmakers are responsible. Bessie becomes completely unimportant to the story because despite her absence, Bigger’s story remains relatively the same. 
Bessie is the ultimate victim of <i>Native Son</i>. Whether her victimhood springs from being erased or being raped and murdered, Bessie’s story is one of objectification and marginalization.  Though she appears in completely different capacities in the film and novel, Bessie is used and disregarded in both, and brings light to the treatment of the black woman by society. </p>
