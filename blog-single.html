						<h2> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/plastic-wars/"> Plastic Wars Documentary </a></h2>
						<h4>Summary:</h4>
						<p> The documentary Plastic Wars brings up our huge plastics problem, which became a big public topic in the last few years after a viral video about a plastic straw in a sea turtle’s nose. Despite this, the plastic industry is still increasing today. Correspondent Laura Sullivan brings our attention to the overall focus by governments,companies, and individuals on plastic recycling as the solution to this problem. We have been looking to recycling to fix our plastic problem for years, but, as Sullivan informs us, recycling isn’t actually that effective, and not all technically recyclable materials are actually cost effective to recycle. Sullivan delves into the history of plastic, its rise in the post war boom, the first Earth Day, which had mass protests about plastic all over the country, the rise in litter cleanup, and then bans that began on plastic products, which led plastic companies to try to push plastic recycling so that they could still sell plastic and improve the image of their products. Unlike most people might believe, recycling wasn’t an effort created to decrease plastic waste, but more an effort to have plastics appear less bad so that it would be bought. The plastic recycling symbols on items with the arrows and the numbers in the middle were also pushed by the industry, with different numbers representing the “class” of material. This was also a ploy for the industry to make plastics that were not being recycled because of lack of cost effectiveness, to still appear to be recyclable, so that consumers would believe more was being recycled than what actually was, and not be concerned about plastics and the environment. The industry didn’t even believe that recycling would ever happen largescale because it wouldn’t be economically viable. They also ran ad campaigns for plastic, raising its favorability from 30 to 60%. On camera, Sullivan goes to a place that sells materials for recycling, looks at their operations, and goes with them to overseas to check that the plastic scrap is actually being recycled. (Many companies do not actually check or know if their material is being recycled.) She shows the issues of plastic waste contamination in scrap, and talks about how China stopped taking imported plastic waste in 2018 due to this issue. In Indonesia, this is still currently a huge issue, as big as narcotics. Plastic dumping and burning in parts of poor areas is a practice that occurs, causing health issues for people and tons of waste, as companies like New Harvest Indo can put unusable plastic into the community 2 to 3 times a week. Indonesia has problems with its own waste without the added waste from the US. Sullivan then brings us back to the topic of recycling being pushed by the plastic industry, and shows talk about investing in new recycling technology, and new plastic sorting machines which are supported by the plastics industry, which one sorting company says was useless and that they sold it for parts.  She talks about plastic ads coming back, with the same messaging as in the past, while recycling is still not effective, and no more than 10% of plastic has ever been recycled. She also talks about how the burden of plastic waste is being put on the consumer through this idea of recycling – that we are the ones who have the control – when really plastic producers are responsible and perpetuate this societal recycling myth. Plastic producers need to be held accountable and should be required to submit all their environmental impacts.  We can’t use recycling to fix our plastic problem, and we have to focus more on reducing and reusing than recycling.
						<h4>My Thoughts:</h4>
						<p> This documentary was super interesting to me and made me see recycling in a new light. I did know before this that recycling wasn’t very effective because of the cost to recycle, but I never knew that the plastic industry was responsible for pushing recycling with the agenda to be able to sell more plastic without people being concerned about the environment. Now that I know, it seems just like something that a giant, environmentally harmful, unethical industry would do to make sure they get their profits, but it is still upsetting especially since it feels like it was so sneaky of the industry – which of course they would want, because otherwise we would see through it and ban plastic. I am really glad that this documentary has come out, because I think it’s important that we don’t let plastic companies brainwash us again like they did in the 90s with the recycling bandaid that makes the issue appear taken care of when it is not. It also makes me want to try to avoid plastics more. I have watched lots of zero waste and environmentalist youtubers, and have always been interested in reducing my waste, but I do feel like this gives me an extra push to do this.  This documentary made me aware of more issues about plastic and that industry than I ever realized, making me question the place of recycling. I think we need to label recycling differently so that only truly recyclable things can have that label, and maybe instead of shipping our waste overseas to be recycled, have some recycling here. This would make us have to actually deal with our own waste, so we would see the issue more and care more about it. I think that some recycling might be still an option, as long as people are made aware of the small amount of things that can be recycled, and as long as recycling is an afterthought to reducing plastics, banning it, (like in the New York State plastic bag bans, but including banning more types of plastics) and holding companies accountable for the waste problem. There are different approaches that can be taken other than sticking the recycling stamp on the issue and pretending that the problem no longer exists. </p>
						<h4>Note:</h4>
						<p>There is one more thing I learned that surprised me that I just had to say. Stores don’t reuse hangers!!! They are used one time!! What the hell? Sorry, just had to have my reaction to this, it just seems so crazy to me that stores buy the same hangers over and over again when they could just reuse the ones they already have.</p>
